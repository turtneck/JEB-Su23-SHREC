I got 2nd overall :DDDDD


## What this repo is
Made on a Linux Ubuntu22 Virtual Machine, this repo is what my folder looked like at home/src

The folders are just the main files in each Architecture where my app was, not the full folders of both Architectures with everything set up
- cFS - my_app
- FPRIME - HelloWorld

## How it worked
- I tested metrics was having the custom app I made in each Architecture being a call to a different algorithym in C that I stored in the 'Algo' folder.
- It was all ran in a overlapping python for easy logging.
- It's very sketchy and patchwork-y to make it all work in time so I could have something cool to present, it is not made to look nice. (some files laying around are just for specific testing of one thing that I used for my presentation)
